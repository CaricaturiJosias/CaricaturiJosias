### What may be weird in this repository
---

- Tests regarding IDE and softwares with github, if you see any of them just ignore it

- Vilcrox: It is a discord bot i made to annoy some close friends, if you are interested in using it as a base code help yourself,
  be aware MySQL is being used to store data and duration of the audio commands, in which the they are only played on local files.

- Any Altium files here will be for practice, unless a FSAE repository is hosted by me in any future occasion

### What i have experience in (**Not professionally**)

- Artificial intelligence: I have done a few works on AI taking an elective class in the first semester of 2021, there is a project simulating the card game "fodeu" with game 
  theory
- Discord python API: I have studied the discord API to make the discord bot, but the lack of knowledge in network lead me to use the python API, since i had no idea on how to
  make protocols
