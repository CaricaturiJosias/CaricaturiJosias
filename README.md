## Who am i

Hi, my name is Gabriel, i am a undergraduate on computer engineering at pontifical catholic university of Paraná (pucpr) in Paraná, Brazil

- Currently on the second half of my fourth year, with expectation of graduation on the perceived course duration (5 years)

- Ex-member of the revitalizing project of pucpr's formula SAE team in the electroeletronic projects department

- Project manager for 1 year for the PUCPR Computer engineering Junior company FRACTAL

- Right know i am working as a software developer intern inside Siemens's R&D department, i am inclined towards distributed and embedded systems, so i might look for new opportunities or expanding my current position to said fields on the future

## What you will find in this repository

- Repositories used for storing and keeping track of any academic production on my personal machine, the repository will mainly include programming languages used on my classes and activities requested during the pandemic (Mostly code scripts and structures to CAD like files) 

- Training repositories, some of them regard online courses (Udemy, LinkedIn Learning and others)

- Research inclined repositories (Thesis and scientific research)

### What may be weird in this repository

- Tests regarding IDE's and softwares with github, if you see any of them just ignore it

- Vilcrox: It is a discord bot i made to annoy some close friends, if you are interested in using it as a base code help yourself,
  be aware Firebase is being used to store the name and duration of the audio commands, in which the they are only played on local files.

## What i have experience in 

### (**Professionally**)

- Python automation: I making automated tests using abstracted bash commands in Linux (RHEL 8) and Windows 10 to check database and algorithm calculation functionallity in a evergrowing and complex software project.

- C/C++ development: I create and research functionallities inside the project i work on, specially in receiver-end'ish type treatment for sockets (i do not work with IP/TCP, WIFI and other types of internet connection kind of processes), I also work on refactoring and introducing design patterns and new technologies into a +30 year old critical infrastructure software project

- C/C++ maintenance: I correct defects at base level on the system i work with as the project is expanded and modified (Memory allocation through components, information processing, bad programming practices done previously on the code). I am also working on major refactorings of dataservers and core business applications of the system for many reasons (EOL 3pps, performance issues, introduction of new technologies like REST/microservices in general)

### (**Not professionally**)

- Artificial intelligence: I have done a few works on AI taking an elective class in the first semester of 2021, there is a project simulating the card game "fodeu" with game 
  theory
- Discord python API: I have studied the discord API to make the discord bot, but the lack of knowledge in network lead me to use the python API, since i had no idea on how to
  make protocols
