## Who i am

Hi, my name is Gabriel, i am a undergraduate on computer engineering at pontifical catholic university of Paraná (pucpr) in Paraná, Brazil

- Currently on the first half of my fourth year, with expectation of graduation on the perceived course duration (5 years)

- Ex-member of the revitalizing project of pucpr's formula SAE team in the electroeletronic projects department

## What you will find in this repository

- The chance of you finding any professional level stuff in here is very low, most of what i code and produce in here is currently at amateur, academic level, what is made at a professional level is mostly keep on my current GitLab access where i work.

- Right know i am working as a software developer intern inside Siemens R&D department, i am inclined towards firmware and hardware, so i might look for new opportunities on said fields on the future  

### What may be weird in this repository


- Tests regarding IDE and softwares with github, if you see any of them just ignore it

- Vilcrox: It is a discord bot i made to annoy some close friends, if you are interested in using it as a base code help yourself,
  be aware MySQL is being used to store data and duration of the audio commands, in which the they are only played on local files.

- Any Altium files here will be for practice, unless a FSAE repository is hosted by me in any future occasion

### What i have experience in (**Professionally**)

- Python automation: I making automated tests using abstracted bash commands in Linux (RHEL 8) and Windows 10 to check database and algorithm calculation functionallity in a evergrowing and complex software project.
- C/C++ development: I create and research functionallities inside the project i work on, specially in receiver-end'ish type treatment for sockets (i do not work with IP/TCP, WIFI and other types of internet connection kind of processes)
- C/C++ maintenance: I correct defects at base level on the system i work with as the project is expanded and modified (Memory allocation through components, information processing, bad programming practices done previously on the code)

### What i have experience in (**Not professionally**)

- Artificial intelligence: I have done a few works on AI taking an elective class in the first semester of 2021, there is a project simulating the card game "fodeu" with game 
  theory
- Discord python API: I have studied the discord API to make the discord bot, but the lack of knowledge in network lead me to use the python API, since i had no idea on how to
  make protocols
